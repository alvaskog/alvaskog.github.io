          <p>These three posters was shortlisted in the </p> <p>V&A Illustration Awards 2018, student category. I was Highly Commended.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In these three posters I explore representations of femininity and female identity positions. Each poster is based on a stereotypically male identity position that is not usually associated with or accessible for women. How can such positions represent women without sexualizing them? I have considered the characters physical positions and I am very conscious of not sexualizing the characters.</p>
