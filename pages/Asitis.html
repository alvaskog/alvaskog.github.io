            This is one sculpture from a series of three that will be launched in June/July 2018. With inspiration from women and non-binary people, that are pushing the boundaries of gender identity, I have designed the sculptures As, It and Is. They challenge narrow body ideals. Free from sexualisation, with their big hands and feet they are not afraid to take up space. My wish is to criticise body ideals and demands of conforming to bodily perfection and to celebrate difference since difference is great and As It Is. These sculptures is a collaboration with Unique Board. You can buy them at www.uniqueboard.com
